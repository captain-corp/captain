# Captain

Captain is an experimental blog engine entirely written by AI models. This project explores the possibilities and limitations of AI-generated software by creating a fully functional blogging platform. Every line of code, from the architecture decisions to the implementation details, has been crafted through AI assistance.

## Contributing

This project is an AI-first experiment. While all contributions are welcome, we encourage:

1. Using AI assistants (like GitHub Copilot) for code generation
2. Documenting AI-human collaboration in pull requests
3. Sharing insights about AI-assisted development
